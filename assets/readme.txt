Quake Rev PAK 
Release 4
*****************************************************************************

In order to install Quake Rev PAK, copy all the files in this archive into
the /apps/QRevPAK/ folder in your storage media (SD card or USB stick), then 
launch it from the Homebrew Channel, or any suitable app launcher in your 
Wii console.

For more information on how to use Quake Rev PAK, visit
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/QRevPAK .

AND REMEMBER: This being a collection of engines, you will need the data from
each game copied into that same folder. So, if you haven't bought any of the 
Quake games, WHAT THE F%@K ARE YOU WAITING FOR? The folks at id Software worked
very hard to create these games, so give them some recognition and GO BUY THEM. 
Understood?

(You can still use Quake Rev PAK with the shareware game files if you want, 
but hey, why would you?)
