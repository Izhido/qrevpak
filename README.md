# Quake Rev PAK

A collection of gaming engines, related to the Quake series of games by id Software, modified to run on the Nintendo Wii, using the popular devkitPPC toolchain for homebrew development.

***************************************************
# IMPORTANT:

This project is now discontinued. No further work will be applied to it. This repository will be kept here for historical purposes.

The version of the compiler toolchain used by this project, as well as related libraries, is no longer supported in the newest releases - for this reason, you won't be able to compile and run this project unless you upgrade it to the newest toolchain (and supporting libraries).
In addition, the newest updates to the console might make it harder to run homebrew code without a bit of research on what functionality the updates have blocked.
