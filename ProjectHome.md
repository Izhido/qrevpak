### Introduction ###

Quake Rev PAK is a collection of gaming engines, related to the [Quake](http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/)
series of games by [id Software](http://www.idsoftware.com/), modified to run on the [Nintendo Wii](http://www.nintendo.com/wii), using the popular [devkitPPC](http://www.devkitpro.org/) toolchain for homebrew development.

### Releases ###

_Release 4_ is out!

Relevant changes include:

  * New GX-accelerated builds of Q2Rev and Q2CTFRev.
  * Support for the official Quake and Quake II Mission Packs, now available in the Quake Rev PAK launcher.
  * Lots of bug fixes, including an embarrasing one where left & right sound channels were inverted (oops!)
  * Fixed a problem with Quake II savegame files, which were not compatible between releases. Starting from Release 4, all _new_ savegame files will work as expected.
  * Also starting from this release, it will be required that the game data folders be located inside folders called "Q1" and "Q2" at the engines folder level. This will help having Quake and Quake II data separated, and thus be able to play the "rogue" Mission Packs (Dissolution of Eternity, Ground Zero).

**NOTICE**: The config.cfg data generated by previous releases of the Q2Rev and Q2CTFRev engines might contain invalid data. It is recommended that you delete them before playing the Quake II games. The engines will recreate the config.cfg files when they are not found.

### Contributions ###

Any new related contributions, be patches, mods, freely available data files, even whole new projects, are welcome. Just be sure:

  1. That the contribution can be made available through the GNU GPL v2 license (the license in use by the engines);
  1. To assert your copyright (or the one from the creators of the contribution) somewhere in it;
  1. That the new contribution does not interfere in the way the existing builds work (that is, replacing functionality without providing an alternative where the original functionality would still work); if that would happen, you can always create a whole new project with your own rules and request it to be added to the repository;
  1. That, of course, the contribution does not "break the build".
